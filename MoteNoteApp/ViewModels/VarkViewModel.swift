/// Turn this into a Model
/// it too clunky and redoes a lot of the things the profileviewmodel does
/// make profileviewmodel hold users varks and add vark to this list when taken
/// model needs to have function to submit -- just submits to database
/// in View -- add submitted vark to local list of varks
